# MediaHandling

This is a library solely intended for the use in the project [Chestnut](https://github.com/jonno85uk/chestnut)
by handling all media-file operations (reading/decoding/encoding).
This is done by abstracting the underlying media library with a common interface.
Currently, only the [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) library is being used.
