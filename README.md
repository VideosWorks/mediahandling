# MediaHandling [![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/fd1f6eda59fd4bdbbe54c90bac7300d5)](https://www.codacy.com/manual/jonno85uk/mediahandling?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=jonno85uk/mediahandling&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

This is a library solely intended for the use in the project [Chestnut](https://github.com/jonno85uk/chestnut)
by handling all media-file operations (reading/decoding/encoding).
This is done by abstracting the underlying media library with a common interface.
Currently, only the [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) library is being used.
